Utility to install OpenStack on RHEL 6.4 (Openstack Grizzly)
See other branches for older openstack versions

This utility can be used to install openstack on a single or
group of hosts (over ssh)

This utility is still in the early stages, a lot of the configuration
options have yet to be added

Installation
$ rpm -Uvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
$ yum install -y git
$ git clone --recursive git://github.com/stackforge/packstack.git
$ cd packstack

Option 1 (using answer file)
$ ./bin/packstack --gen-answer-file=ans.txt

# then edit ans.txt as appropriate e.g.
o set CONFIG_SSH_KEY to a public ssh key to be installed to remote machines
o Edit the IP address to anywhere you want to install a piece of openstack on another server
o Edit the 3 network interfaces to whatever makes sense in your setup

you'll need to use a grizzly repository for example for RHEL
CONFIG_REPO=http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/openstack/openstack-grizzly/epel-6/

$ ./bin/packstack --answer-file=ans.txt

Option 2 (prompts for configuration options)
$ ./bin/packstack

thats it, if everything went well you can now start using openstack
$ cd
$ . keystonerc_admin
$ nova list
$ swift list  # if you have installed swift


Config options
CONFIG_NOVA_COMPUTE_HOSTS :
        a comma seperated list of ip addresses on which to install nova compute
CONFIG_SWIFT_STORAGE_HOSTS :
        a comma seperate list of swift storage devices
        1.1.1.1  : create a testing loopback device and use this for storage
        1.1.1.1/sdb : use /dev/sdb on 1.1.1.1 as a storage device
